# Findings

Every reverse-engineered decision of the port, with the hypothesis, the alternatives tried, the metric against the
oracle and the winner. Code comments cite entries by id (`F-001`).

Oracle: Needle 3 engine 3.2.0 (`Cactus-Compute/needle3` @ `2ae11323dc`, macos-arm64) with `whistle.cact` from
`Cactus-Compute/whistle` @ `b358ddad`.

## F-001 — `needle_embed` speech output shape (2026-10-09)

**Question.** `needle.h` says a speech embedding is "one row of that width per 80 ms frame, flattened" but gives
neither the width nor how a partial frame counts.

**Measured.** A null-output call returns the float count without computing. On synthetic PCM:

| samples | 1280 | 1281 | 2560 | 16000 | 32000 | 48000 | 160000 |
| ------- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ------ |
| floats  | 512  | 512  | 1024 | 6656  | 12800 | 19456 | 64000  |
| frames  | 1    | 1    | 2    | 13    | 25    | 38    | 125    |

**Alternatives.**

- `ceil(samples / 1280)`: rejected, because 1281 samples give 1 frame, not 2.
- `floor(samples / 1280)`: rejected, because 16000 samples give 13 frames, not 12.
- `(samples + 640) / 1280` in integer division (round half up): fits all seven lengths.

**Winner.** The width is **512 floats per frame**, and frames = `(samples + 640) / 1280` in integer division. That is
an 80 ms hop at 16 kHz. All 32 corpus clips (`testdata/oracle`) return a multiple of 512 floats.

The engine does not say whether 512 is the encoder width or a projection of it; Phase 4 settles that against the
safetensors weights. `tools/oracle` stores each embedding as F32 `embed` `[frames, 512]` in
`testdata/oracle/<clip>.embed.safetensors`.

## F-002 — `needle` CLI transcription output (2026-10-09)

**Measured.** `needle --model whistle.cact --audio clip.wav --audio-word-timestamps` prints one JSON object on stdout
and nothing on stderr:
`{"text", "language", "words": [{"word", "start", "end", "probability"}], "ttft_ms", "decode_tps"}`.

- Times are in seconds with two decimals. All 918 word boundaries in the corpus lie on the 80 ms grid, the same hop
  as F-001.
- Probabilities have three decimals.
- `words` keeps punctuation attached to the word (`"an,"`, `"Nichtgewachsen."`).

**Determinism.** `ttft_ms` and `decode_tps` are wall-clock measurements, so `tools/oracle` drops them. With those
removed, two runs of the whole corpus give byte-identical JSON and embeddings (macos-arm64, default threads).

**Language detection** matched the corpus language on 32 of 32 clips.

## F-003 — `.cact` header vs the safetensors config (2026-10-09)

**Question.** The `.cact` header (`export.py` `_HDR_FMT "<48If"`) is written for Needle's text model
(`num_heads`, `hada_n`, `engram_*`), while `whistle.safetensors` stores the Whistle config as JSON. Which header field
corresponds to which config key, and does the header describe the encoder at all?

**Measured.** `internal/cact` `TestWhistleCactMatchesConfig` reads both files at `b358ddad`:

| `.cact` header                  | value        | safetensors config / run      |
| ------------------------------- | ------------ | ----------------------------- |
| `vocab`                         | 8199         | `text` + 7 language tokens    |
| `d_model`                       | 512          | `dim`                         |
| `num_kv_heads`                  | 2            | `kv_heads`                    |
| `num_layers`                    | 8            | `dec_layers` (= `enc_layers`) |
| `qk_head_dim`, `v_head_dim`     | 48, 64       | `qk_dim`, `v_dim`             |
| `max_seq_len`                   | 320          | `max_tokens`                  |
| `hada_n`                        | 512          | next power of two of `dim`    |
| `mhc_lanes`                     | 4            | `lanes` (= `enc_lanes`)       |
| `qkv_conv_taps`                 | 3            | `taps`                        |
| `engram_slots`                  | 18432        | `slots`                       |
| `num_engram_tables`             | 4            | `len(orders)` × `hashes`      |
| `engram_sub_dim`                | 128          | `dim` / tables                |
| `engram_conv_dilation`          | 3            | `max(orders)`                 |
| `engram_orders`, `engram_sites` | [2,3], [3,7] | `orders`, `sites`             |
| `rope_theta`                    | 1e5          | `rope`                        |
| `kv_bits`                       | 8            | `run.kv_bits`                 |

The header holds three values the config does not state: `num_heads` = 8, `engram_conv_taps` = 4 (the `export.py`
constant `ENGRAM_CONV_TAPS`) and `kv_window` = 0. `out_vocab`, `sliding_window`, the global mask and
`engram_seed_heads` are all 0.

**Conclusion.** The header carries the fields `export.py` writes for Needle's text model, so it describes the
**decoder**: vocab, engram and the Q/K/V taps exist only there. Whistle's encoder and decoder both have 8 layers and 4
mHC lanes, so `num_layers` and `mhc_lanes` cannot tell the two apart; the decoder reading is the one consistent with
the rest of the header. The encoder (`conv_kernel`, `stem`, `stem_stages`) and the front end (`mels`, `rate`, `fft`,
`win`, `hop`) are not in the header. They appear in the 13-float FP32 tensor #237,
`[3246, 1, 8192, 8, 4, 9, 128, 3, 80, 16000, 512, 400, 160]`: from the third value on it equals `text`,
`enc_layers`, `enc_lanes`, `conv_kernel`, `stem`, `stem_stages`, `mels`, `rate`, `fft`, `win` and `hop` (asserted by
the same test). The first two values stay open for the tensor-name map (Phase 1).

Also measured: the header is 196 bytes, not the 120 the `export.py` docstring states; the codebooks are stored already
scaled by 1/√128 (cb2 = ±0.0399, ±0.1333); blobs are 64-byte aligned and contiguous, and the last one ends exactly at
EOF. Whistle uses only CQ2 (145 tensors) and CQ4 (7), both with group 128; there is no CQ3, ternary or binary tensor.

## F-004 — CQ dequantisation (2026-10-09)

**Question.** `export.py` documents the CQ blob, and `_cq_unpack` decodes it, but only `_cq_pack` at
`WEIGHT_BITS` = 4 writes one. Does Whistle's `.cact` follow that code exactly: which codebook, which Hadamard order,
which bit and norm layout? And what should the Go reader do for the widths Whistle does not use?

**Codebook.** `_cq_codebook_np(bits, group)` draws 400,000 samples from numpy's `RandomState(0)` and runs 200 Lloyd-Max
iterations. Rerunning that code with numpy reproduces all 28 header floats of `whistle.cact` bit for bit as
`_cq_codebook_np(2|3|4, 128)`. Winner: `File.CQ` uses the stored codebook and does not port the RNG; the tests carry
the float64 unit levels. Caveat: the header holds one codebook, scaled by 1/√group of the export. `_pack_cact` writes
a single group size for every CQ tensor, and every Whistle CQ tensor has group 128, but a file that mixed group sizes
would decode its 2–4-bit tensors with the wrong scale. The 1-bit (±√(2/π)) and ternary (±1.2240064, 0) levels are not
stored. They are scaled per record, as `_cq_codebook_np` does.

**Layout.** Measured as the cosine between `CQ(0)` (CQ4, `[8199, 512]`) and the F32 `embedding/embedding` of
`whistle.safetensors`:

| decoding                                                                 | cosine      |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------- |
| `_cq_unpack`: LSB-first, low nibble = even column, norms `[out][groups]` | **0.99537** |
| high nibble = even column                                                | −0.01339    |
| norms stored group-major, `[groups][out]`                                | 0.91511     |

The winner's worst row cosine is 0.98980. For a 4-bit Gaussian Lloyd-Max quantiser, the expected cosine is
√(1 − 0.0095) ≈ 0.9952. The unit round trip (`TestCQ_RoundTrip`) also lands on the textbook distortions, with a
relative error of 0.60 / 0.34 / 0.17 / 0.09 for 1 / 2 / 3 / 4 bits.

**Rotation.** `_cq_hadamard_np` builds Sylvester's matrix (`np.block([[H, H], [H, -H]])`) in natural order. It is
symmetric and orthonormal, so the inverse of the pack rotation `g @ H` is `@ H` again. `fwht` applies the ±1 part with
in-place butterflies; the 1/√group factor is folded into the norm. The explicit matrix stays in the tests as the
reference. The ternary one-hot tests pin the row order by hand.

**Numerics.** float32, as upstream. A float64 matrix reference agrees with `CQ` within the float32 bound
γ(log2(group) + 3) · Σ|x| / √group. On `whistle.cact`, numpy's `_cq_unpack` and `CQ` differ by about 1e-8 of the row
norm, where the test allows 1e-5. All 145 CQ2 and 7 CQ4 tensors are finite, with an RMS between 1e-3 and 10, and the
largest |w| over all of them is 69.29.

**Widths outside Whistle.** 1-bit and ternary are implemented as `_cq_unpack` does them: eight 1-bit indices per
byte, and ternary crumbs 3/0/1 → trits 0/1/2. They are only covered by unit tests. Two inputs fail upstream, so they
are errors here: crumb 2 (numpy raises `IndexError` on the 3-level codebook), and a group that is not a power of two
(`_cq_hadamard_np` overshoots the group and the matmul fails).

## F-005 — Tokenizer blob, decode rules and the sentencepiece fixture (2026-10-09)

**Question.** Does the RAW blob (`.cact` #680) follow `export.py` `_tokenizer_blob`? `Cactus-Compute/whistle` ships no
`tokenizer.model`, so what is a trustworthy sentencepiece reference for decode? And where sentencepiece and upstream
`RefTokenizer` disagree, which one does the port follow?

**Measured (blob).** 109,231 bytes in the `_TK_HDR`/`_TK_REC` layout, with the last record ending exactly at the end
of the blob. Header: 8199 pieces, pad/eos/bos/unk = 0/1/2/3, `add_dummy_prefix` 0, `byte_fallback` 1. Types: 7908
NORMAL, 256 BYTE (ids 28–283, `<0x00>`…`<0xFF>`), 31 USER_DEFINED, 3 CONTROL (0–2) and 1 UNKNOWN (3). NORMAL scores
are minus the merge rank, 0 to −7907, all distinct; every other piece scores 0. The USER_DEFINED pieces are ids 4–27
(24 chat markers, including `<image>`, `<speech>`, `<tts>` and `<imagen>`) and the language tokens 8192–8198
(`<|en|>`, `<|de|>`, `<|fr|>`, `<|es|>`, `<|it|>`, `<|nl|>`, `<|pl|>`).

Upstream `_tokenizer_blob` marks only the 16 `CHAT_MARKERS` as USER_DEFINED. It would have typed `<image>`,
`<speech>`, `<tts>`, `<imagen>` and the language tokens as NORMAL, so the pinned exporter did not write Whistle's blob.
The blob's types match the sentencepiece model's own flags instead: needle3's `user_defined_symbols` lists all 24
markers. As a result, `Encode` cuts `<speech>` and the language tokens out whole.

**Fixture route.** `scripts/tokenizer_fixture.py` rebuilds a sentencepiece BPE `ModelProto` from the blob's pieces,
scores and types. Its normalizer and trainer settings copy needle3's model: `identity` normalizer, no dummy prefix, no
whitespace collapsing, `byte_fallback`, `split_by_whitespace` and a maximum piece length of 16. The script asserts that
the loaded model reports the blob's piece, score and type back for all 8199 ids. needle3's `tokenizer.model` (@
`2ae11323dc`, sha256 `97dfd566…1b25`) served as a cross-check: the script's `--needle3` flag runs that comparison and
only prints, so the fixture does not depend on the download. Results:

- Pieces, scores and types: 0 of 8192 differ from blob ids 0–8191.
- Decode: 104/104 fixture sequences that use only shared ids are equal, and so are 8192/8192 single ids.
- Encode: 24/24 samples without language tokens are equal.

The rebuilt model and the published needle3 model therefore agree everywhere they overlap. The rebuilt model also
covers the 7 language tokens. The decode logic is sentencepiece's own (0.2.2).

One setting deviates on purpose: `unk_surface` is `""`. sentencepiece prints `" ⁇ "` for `<unk>` by default, while
`RefTokenizer` and PLAN.md skip it. Only sequences containing id 3 are affected.

**Disagreements.** `RefTokenizer.decode` differs from sentencepiece on 11 of the 109 fixture sequences. All 11 are
byte-fallback corner cases:

1. Invalid UTF-8. sentencepiece writes one U+FFFD per invalid byte (`E2 82` → `��`). Python's `errors="replace"` writes
   one per maximal subpart (`E2 82` → `�`).
2. Byte runs. sentencepiece decodes each run of consecutive BYTE pieces on its own, so a CONTROL or UNKNOWN piece
   between two runs ends the first one (`<0xC3> <pad> <0xA9>` → `��`). `RefTokenizer` joins all bytes first (→ `é`).
3. `▁` spelled by bytes. sentencepiece turns `▁` into a space only in piece surfaces (`<0xE2><0x96><0x81>` → `▁`).
   `RefTokenizer` replaces it after the join (→ a space).

**Winner.** `Decode` follows sentencepiece, as the Accept criterion asks; for case 1 that is also what
`utf8.DecodeRune` gives. Well-formed output never reaches these cases. The engine's behaviour on them is unknown, so
revisit this if a transcript ever differs on one. `Encode` is a straight port of `RefTokenizer`. Unlike
sentencepiece, it does not split at whitespace before the BPE, but on all 25 fixture samples (Latin, accented
European, Cyrillic, CJK, Arabic, Hebrew, Devanagari, emoji, markers, language tokens, whitespace and control
characters) `RefTokenizer` and sentencepiece give identical ids. Go matches `RefTokenizer` on 25/25 and round-trips all
25, plus 11 more texts in `TestWhistleRoundTrip`. Text containing a literal `▁` cannot round-trip, because encode
cannot tell it apart from an escaped space.

The Go side differs from upstream in three more places:

- `Parse` is stricter than `parse_tokenizer_blob`. It rejects trailing bytes, unknown types, malformed or repeated byte
  pieces, out-of-range special ids, and byte fallback without all 256 byte pieces.
- `Encode` carries invalid UTF-8 input, which a Python `str` cannot hold, byte by byte into byte pieces.
- `Decode` returns an error for an id out of range, where sentencepiece raises.

Regenerate with `just tokenizer-fixture [--needle3 tokenizer.model]`. The model-gated tests in `internal/tokenizer`
read `testdata/tokenizer/whistle.json`.
