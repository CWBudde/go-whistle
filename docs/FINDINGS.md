# Findings

Every reverse-engineered decision of the port, with the hypothesis, the alternatives tried, the metric against the
oracle and the winner. Code comments cite entries by id (`F-001`).

Oracle: Needle 3 engine 3.2.0 (`Cactus-Compute/needle3` @ `2ae11323dc`, macos-arm64) with `whistle.cact` from
`Cactus-Compute/whistle` @ `b358ddad`.

## F-001 — `needle_embed` speech output shape (2026-10-09)

**Question.** `needle.h` says a speech embedding is "one row of that width per 80 ms frame, flattened" but gives
neither the width nor how a partial frame counts.

**Measured.** A null-output call returns the float count without computing. On synthetic PCM:

| samples | 1280 | 1281 | 2560 | 16000 | 32000 | 48000 | 160000 |
| ------- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ------ |
| floats  | 512  | 512  | 1024 | 6656  | 12800 | 19456 | 64000  |
| frames  | 1    | 1    | 2    | 13    | 25    | 38    | 125    |

**Alternatives.**

- `ceil(samples / 1280)`: rejected, because 1281 samples give 1 frame, not 2.
- `floor(samples / 1280)`: rejected, because 16000 samples give 13 frames, not 12.
- `(samples + 640) / 1280` in integer division (round half up): fits all seven lengths.

**Winner.** The width is **512 floats per frame**, and frames = `(samples + 640) / 1280` in integer division. That is
an 80 ms hop at 16 kHz. All 32 corpus clips (`testdata/oracle`) return a multiple of 512 floats.

The engine does not say whether 512 is the encoder width or a projection of it; Phase 4 settles that against the
safetensors weights. `tools/oracle` stores each embedding as F32 `embed` `[frames, 512]` in
`testdata/oracle/<clip>.embed.safetensors`.

## F-002 — `needle` CLI transcription output (2026-10-09)

**Measured.** `needle --model whistle.cact --audio clip.wav --audio-word-timestamps` prints one JSON object on stdout
and nothing on stderr:
`{"text", "language", "words": [{"word", "start", "end", "probability"}], "ttft_ms", "decode_tps"}`.

- Times are in seconds with two decimals. All 918 word boundaries in the corpus lie on the 80 ms grid, the same hop
  as F-001.
- Probabilities have three decimals.
- `words` keeps punctuation attached to the word (`"an,"`, `"Nichtgewachsen."`).

**Determinism.** `ttft_ms` and `decode_tps` are wall-clock measurements, so `tools/oracle` drops them. With those
removed, two runs of the whole corpus give byte-identical JSON and embeddings (macos-arm64, default threads).

**Language detection** matched the corpus language on 32 of 32 clips.

## F-003 — `.cact` header vs the safetensors config (2026-10-09)

**Question.** The `.cact` header (`export.py` `_HDR_FMT "<48If"`) is written for Needle's text model
(`num_heads`, `hada_n`, `engram_*`), while `whistle.safetensors` stores the Whistle config as JSON. Which header field
corresponds to which config key, and does the header describe the encoder at all?

**Measured.** `internal/cact` `TestWhistleCactMatchesConfig` reads both files at `b358ddad`:

| `.cact` header                  | value        | safetensors config / run      |
| ------------------------------- | ------------ | ----------------------------- |
| `vocab`                         | 8199         | `text` + 7 language tokens    |
| `d_model`                       | 512          | `dim`                         |
| `num_kv_heads`                  | 2            | `kv_heads`                    |
| `num_layers`                    | 8            | `dec_layers` (= `enc_layers`) |
| `qk_head_dim`, `v_head_dim`     | 48, 64       | `qk_dim`, `v_dim`             |
| `max_seq_len`                   | 320          | `max_tokens`                  |
| `hada_n`                        | 512          | next power of two of `dim`    |
| `mhc_lanes`                     | 4            | `lanes` (= `enc_lanes`)       |
| `qkv_conv_taps`                 | 3            | `taps`                        |
| `engram_slots`                  | 18432        | `slots`                       |
| `num_engram_tables`             | 4            | `len(orders)` × `hashes`      |
| `engram_sub_dim`                | 128          | `dim` / tables                |
| `engram_conv_dilation`          | 3            | `max(orders)`                 |
| `engram_orders`, `engram_sites` | [2,3], [3,7] | `orders`, `sites`             |
| `rope_theta`                    | 1e5          | `rope`                        |
| `kv_bits`                       | 8            | `run.kv_bits`                 |

The header holds three values the config does not state: `num_heads` = 8, `engram_conv_taps` = 4 (the `export.py`
constant `ENGRAM_CONV_TAPS`) and `kv_window` = 0. `out_vocab`, `sliding_window`, the global mask and
`engram_seed_heads` are all 0.

**Conclusion.** The header carries the fields `export.py` writes for Needle's text model, so it describes the
**decoder**: vocab, engram and the Q/K/V taps exist only there. Whistle's encoder and decoder both have 8 layers and 4
mHC lanes, so `num_layers` and `mhc_lanes` cannot tell the two apart; the decoder reading is the one consistent with
the rest of the header. The encoder (`conv_kernel`, `stem`, `stem_stages`) and the front end (`mels`, `rate`, `fft`,
`win`, `hop`) are not in the header. They appear in the 13-float FP32 tensor #237,
`[3246, 1, 8192, 8, 4, 9, 128, 3, 80, 16000, 512, 400, 160]`: from the third value on it equals `text`,
`enc_layers`, `enc_lanes`, `conv_kernel`, `stem`, `stem_stages`, `mels`, `rate`, `fft`, `win` and `hop` (asserted by
the same test). F-006 explains the first two values: a magic and a format version.

Also measured: the header is 196 bytes, not the 120 the `export.py` docstring states; the codebooks are stored already
scaled by 1/√128 (cb2 = ±0.0399, ±0.1333); blobs are 64-byte aligned and contiguous, and the last one ends exactly at
EOF. Whistle uses only CQ2 (145 tensors) and CQ4 (7), both with group 128; there is no CQ3, ternary or binary tensor.

## F-004 — CQ dequantisation (2026-10-09)

**Question.** `export.py` documents the CQ blob, and `_cq_unpack` decodes it, but only `_cq_pack` at
`WEIGHT_BITS` = 4 writes one. Does Whistle's `.cact` follow that code exactly: which codebook, which Hadamard order,
which bit and norm layout? And what should the Go reader do for the widths Whistle does not use?

**Codebook.** `_cq_codebook_np(bits, group)` draws 400,000 samples from numpy's `RandomState(0)` and runs 200 Lloyd-Max
iterations. Rerunning that code with numpy reproduces all 28 header floats of `whistle.cact` bit for bit as
`_cq_codebook_np(2|3|4, 128)`. Winner: `File.CQ` uses the stored codebook and does not port the RNG; the tests carry
the float64 unit levels. Caveat: the header holds one codebook, scaled by 1/√group of the export. `_pack_cact` writes
a single group size for every CQ tensor, and every Whistle CQ tensor has group 128, but a file that mixed group sizes
would decode its 2–4-bit tensors with the wrong scale. The 1-bit (±√(2/π)) and ternary (±1.2240064, 0) levels are not
stored. They are scaled per record, as `_cq_codebook_np` does.

**Layout.** Measured as the cosine between `CQ(0)` (CQ4, `[8199, 512]`) and the F32 `embedding/embedding` of
`whistle.safetensors`:

| decoding                                                                 | cosine      |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------- |
| `_cq_unpack`: LSB-first, low nibble = even column, norms `[out][groups]` | **0.99537** |
| high nibble = even column                                                | −0.01339    |
| norms stored group-major, `[groups][out]`                                | 0.91511     |

The winner's worst row cosine is 0.98980. For a 4-bit Gaussian Lloyd-Max quantiser, the expected cosine is
√(1 − 0.0095) ≈ 0.9952. The unit round trip (`TestCQ_RoundTrip`) also lands on the textbook distortions, with a
relative error of 0.60 / 0.34 / 0.17 / 0.09 for 1 / 2 / 3 / 4 bits.

**Rotation.** `_cq_hadamard_np` builds Sylvester's matrix (`np.block([[H, H], [H, -H]])`) in natural order. It is
symmetric and orthonormal, so the inverse of the pack rotation `g @ H` is `@ H` again. `fwht` applies the ±1 part with
in-place butterflies; the 1/√group factor is folded into the norm. The explicit matrix stays in the tests as the
reference. The ternary one-hot tests pin the row order by hand.

**Numerics.** float32, as upstream. A float64 matrix reference agrees with `CQ` within the float32 bound
γ(log2(group) + 3) · Σ|x| / √group. On `whistle.cact`, numpy's `_cq_unpack` and `CQ` differ by about 1e-8 of the row
norm, where the test allows 1e-5. All 145 CQ2 and 7 CQ4 tensors are finite, with an RMS between 1e-3 and 10, and the
largest |w| over all of them is 69.29.

**Widths outside Whistle.** 1-bit and ternary are implemented as `_cq_unpack` does them: eight 1-bit indices per
byte, and ternary crumbs 3/0/1 → trits 0/1/2. They are only covered by unit tests. Two inputs fail upstream, so they
are errors here: crumb 2 (numpy raises `IndexError` on the 3-level codebook), and a group that is not a power of two
(`_cq_hadamard_np` overshoots the group and the matmul fails).

## F-005 — Tokenizer blob, decode rules and the sentencepiece fixture (2026-10-09)

**Question.** Does the RAW blob (`.cact` #680) follow `export.py` `_tokenizer_blob`? `Cactus-Compute/whistle` ships no
`tokenizer.model`, so what is a trustworthy sentencepiece reference for decode? And where sentencepiece and upstream
`RefTokenizer` disagree, which one does the port follow?

**Measured (blob).** 109,231 bytes in the `_TK_HDR`/`_TK_REC` layout, with the last record ending exactly at the end
of the blob. Header: 8199 pieces, pad/eos/bos/unk = 0/1/2/3, `add_dummy_prefix` 0, `byte_fallback` 1. Types: 7908
NORMAL, 256 BYTE (ids 28–283, `<0x00>`…`<0xFF>`), 31 USER_DEFINED, 3 CONTROL (0–2) and 1 UNKNOWN (3). NORMAL scores
are minus the merge rank, 0 to −7907, all distinct; every other piece scores 0. The USER_DEFINED pieces are ids 4–27
(24 chat markers, including `<image>`, `<speech>`, `<tts>` and `<imagen>`) and the language tokens 8192–8198
(`<|en|>`, `<|de|>`, `<|fr|>`, `<|es|>`, `<|it|>`, `<|nl|>`, `<|pl|>`).

Upstream `_tokenizer_blob` marks only the 16 `CHAT_MARKERS` as USER_DEFINED. It would have typed `<image>`,
`<speech>`, `<tts>`, `<imagen>` and the language tokens as NORMAL, so the pinned exporter did not write Whistle's blob.
The blob's types match the sentencepiece model's own flags instead: needle3's `user_defined_symbols` lists all 24
markers. As a result, `Encode` cuts `<speech>` and the language tokens out whole.

**Fixture route.** `scripts/tokenizer_fixture.py` rebuilds a sentencepiece BPE `ModelProto` from the blob's pieces,
scores and types. Its normalizer and trainer settings copy needle3's model: `identity` normalizer, no dummy prefix, no
whitespace collapsing, `byte_fallback`, `split_by_whitespace` and a maximum piece length of 16. The script asserts that
the loaded model reports the blob's piece, score and type back for all 8199 ids. needle3's `tokenizer.model` (@
`2ae11323dc`, sha256 `97dfd566…1b25`) served as a cross-check: the script's `--needle3` flag runs that comparison and
only prints, so the fixture does not depend on the download. Results:

- Pieces, scores and types: 0 of 8192 differ from blob ids 0–8191.
- Decode: 104/104 fixture sequences that use only shared ids are equal, and so are 8192/8192 single ids.
- Encode: 24/24 samples without language tokens are equal.

The rebuilt model and the published needle3 model therefore agree everywhere they overlap. The rebuilt model also
covers the 7 language tokens. The decode logic is sentencepiece's own (0.2.2).

One setting deviates on purpose: `unk_surface` is `""`. sentencepiece prints `" ⁇ "` for `<unk>` by default, while
`RefTokenizer` and PLAN.md skip it. Only sequences containing id 3 are affected.

**Disagreements.** `RefTokenizer.decode` differs from sentencepiece on 11 of the 109 fixture sequences. All 11 are
byte-fallback corner cases:

1. Invalid UTF-8. sentencepiece writes one U+FFFD per invalid byte (`E2 82` → `��`). Python's `errors="replace"` writes
   one per maximal subpart (`E2 82` → `�`).
2. Byte runs. sentencepiece decodes each run of consecutive BYTE pieces on its own, so a CONTROL or UNKNOWN piece
   between two runs ends the first one (`<0xC3> <pad> <0xA9>` → `��`). `RefTokenizer` joins all bytes first (→ `é`).
3. `▁` spelled by bytes. sentencepiece turns `▁` into a space only in piece surfaces (`<0xE2><0x96><0x81>` → `▁`).
   `RefTokenizer` replaces it after the join (→ a space).

**Winner.** `Decode` follows sentencepiece, as the Accept criterion asks; for case 1 that is also what
`utf8.DecodeRune` gives. Well-formed output never reaches these cases. The engine's behaviour on them is unknown, so
revisit this if a transcript ever differs on one. `Encode` is a straight port of `RefTokenizer`. Unlike
sentencepiece, it does not split at whitespace before the BPE, but on all 25 fixture samples (Latin, accented
European, Cyrillic, CJK, Arabic, Hebrew, Devanagari, emoji, markers, language tokens, whitespace and control
characters) `RefTokenizer` and sentencepiece give identical ids. Go matches `RefTokenizer` on 25/25 and round-trips all
25, plus 11 more texts in `TestWhistleRoundTrip`. Text containing a literal `▁` cannot round-trip, because encode
cannot tell it apart from an escaped space.

The Go side differs from upstream in three more places:

- `Parse` is stricter than `parse_tokenizer_blob`. It rejects trailing bytes, unknown types, malformed or repeated byte
  pieces, out-of-range special ids, and byte fallback without all 256 byte pieces.
- `Encode` carries invalid UTF-8 input, which a Python `str` cannot hold, byte by byte into byte pieces.
- `Decode` returns an error for an id out of range, where sentencepiece raises.

Regenerate with `just tokenizer-fixture [--needle3 tokenizer.model]`. The model-gated tests in `internal/tokenizer`
read `testdata/tokenizer/whistle.json`.

## F-006 — Whistle's `.cact` tensor order, transforms and per-tensor checks (2026-10-09)

**Question.** `.cact` records are nameless and positional. Upstream's public exporter (`export.py` `_tensors`) writes
the Needle 3 text model only, and Whistle's audio exporter is not published. Which safetensors tensor feeds each of the
681 records, through which transform? And how is each record shown to be correct?

**Method.** A throw-away Go search scored every record against every shape-compatible candidate by cosine: each of the
116 safetensors tensors whole, each layer slice of the 80 stacked `[8, …]` tensors (unit axes squeezed), plus every
2-D candidate transposed and every mHC φ in export.py's lane-major layout. The search assumed no order. Every sourced
record had one clear winner:

| record type | winner cosine            | best runner-up cosine                                                  |
| ----------- | ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| FP16 vector | ≥ 0.99999996             | 0.999983 (`cross01.k_norm` vs `cross_attn/q_norm[1]`)                  |
| CQ2         | 0.9319–0.9401            | 0.069                                                                  |
| CQ4         | 0.9943–0.9954            | 0.014                                                                  |
| FP16 scalar | ±1 (cosine is only sign) | decided by value: the FP16 of the winner equals the record bit for bit |

The winners form the order below. `internal/cact` `WhistleNames()` encodes it and `testdata/whistle_names.txt` pins it.

| index   | name                     | contents                                                                                                                                 |

The encoder's six norms come in macaron execution order: `pre_hada_norm_0`, `ZCRMSNorm_0`, `post_attn_norm`,
`conv_norm`, `conv_out_norm`, `pre_hada_norm`. All 116 safetensors tensors are used; none is training-only. Every HadamardMLP, the encoder's included, keeps
`_tensors`' inner order (d1, d2, b2, d3, d4, w1a … w3b, cond_v, cond_u). The decoder layers come first and the audio parts follow, each as its own block of eight
layers.

**Transforms.** Four transforms cover every record (`cact.Transform`, applied by `Entry.Apply` after the layer slice):

- `reshape`: the values stay in order. Unit axes are squeezed (`dw` `(9, 1, 512)` → `(9, 512)`), the 3×3 stem kernels
  `(3, 3, 1, 128)` become `(9, 128)`, the engram tables `(4, 18432, 128)` become `(73728, 128)`, and layer scalars
  plus `pe_gate` are stored as `(1,)`.
- `transpose`: every Flax Dense kernel `(in, out)` is stored `(out, in)`. This includes `pw1`/`pw2`, the stem's 1×1
  kernels and `stem/out` `(1280, 512)` → `(512, 1280)`.
- `lane-major`: an mHC φ `(L, n·C, lanes)` is stored as `transpose(0, 2, 1).reshape(L·lanes, n·C)`, as `_tensors`
  does.
- `derived`: records 226, 227, 237, 679 and 680 have no safetensors source.

Read untransposed, no square kernel scores better than the CQ runner-ups (≤ 0.069), so the transposition is not in
doubt.

**Derived records.** Each one is checked by equality:

- `hada_p1`/`hada_p2` equal `np.random.RandomState(11 / 13).permutation(512)` (`_hada_perms` without the split, since
  the config has no `ladder_widths`). A Go port of MT19937 (`init_genrand`) and numpy's legacy shuffle
  (`random_interval` with masked rejection) reproduces both bit for bit. It is pinned to numpy 2.5.3 output and to the
  C++ standard's 10000th `mt19937` value. One pair serves every HadamardMLP, encoder and decoder alike.
- `audio.mel_filters` equals `librosa.filters.mel(sr=16000, n_fft=512, n_mels=80)` with Slaney scale and Slaney norm,
  computed in float64 with numpy's `rfftfreq`/`linspace` arithmetic and rounded **once** to float32: 0 of 20,560
  values differ. librosa's own default path, float32 weights later multiplied by the float64 `enorm`, misses 142
  values by 1 ulp; doing everything in float32 misses 182. The exporter therefore built the bank in float64.
- `audio.manifest` equals 3246 and 1, followed by the eleven config values F-003 lists (`text` … `hop`). F-003 left
  the first two values open. 3246 is `0xCAE`, a magic. The engine (`needle` 3.2.0) was run on a copy of
  `whistle.cact` with one manifest value patched:

  | patched value                   | engine result                                         |
  | ------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
  | `[0]` = 3247 or 0, `[9]` = 8000 | "no speech model loaded" (the file is not recognised) |
  | `[1]` = 2 or 0                  | "failed to load .cact speech model"                   |
  | `[2]` = 8000, `[3]` = 7         | "failed to load .cact speech model"                   |
  | unpatched                       | the normal transcript                                 |

  So the engine finds the manifest by content, as the FP32 `(13,)` record with the magic and a 16 kHz rate. `[1]` is
  a format version it accepts only as 1, and the geometry must agree with the tensors. A static look at
  `libneedle3.dylib`'s `needle_load` with `objdump` had shown the same comparisons (3246.0f, 1.0f, 16000.0f) and led
  to the experiment; no engine code was copied.

- `tokenizer` parses with `internal/tokenizer` (8199 pieces = header `vocab` = `text` + 7, pad/eos/bos 0/1/2 = the
  config). Its sha256 equals the `blob_sha256` of F-005's sentencepiece fixture.

**Thresholds.** They are derived per record, not tuned:

- **FP16** (524 records, 458,057 values). Every value must be the round-to-nearest-even FP16 of its F32 source, and
  all 458,057 are. The cosine must also meet the rounding bound: with |x̂ᵢ − xᵢ| ≤ hᵢ, half an FP16 ulp at xᵢ (2⁻²⁵ in
  the subnormal range), sin θ ≤ ‖h‖/‖x‖, so cos ≥ √(1 − ‖h‖²/‖x‖²). The bounds range
  from 0.99999991 to 0.99999996. The 25 scalars (attention gates, cross gates, `pe_gate`) rest on the exact-value check, since their
  cosine is ±1.
- **CQ** (145 CQ2, 7 CQ4). A Go port of `_cq_pack` (rotate by H/√128 via a float64 FWHT, split off the norm, nearest
  Lloyd-Max level, FP16 norm) requantises each source. The record must equal that blob. The FP16 norms may differ by
  1 ulp, which happens for 11 norms in 10 records. A packed index may differ only by one level, and only where the exact
  unit coordinate lies within 260·2⁻²⁴ ≈ 1.5·10⁻⁵ of the decision boundary between the two levels. That tolerance is
  the float32 error of upstream's rotation: H's rounded entries, γ₁₂₈ for the 128-term sum, and as much again for the
  norm. 16 indices in 14 records differ, all within 2·10⁻¹⁰ to 4·10⁻⁸ of the boundary; every other index of the
  54.7 M CQ weights is identical. The cosine threshold is then cos(acos(cos(Q(src), src)) + asin(2⁻¹⁰)): the quantiser's
  own error on these weights, plus the angle that 1-ulp norm changes (a group scaled by at most 2⁻¹⁰) can add.
  A near-tie flip barely moves the cosine, because u lies about equally far from both levels.
- **Derived FP32 and RAW**: exact equality, as listed above.

**Rejected thresholds.**

- A Gaussian Lloyd-Max floor, √(1 − D) = 0.93941 for CQ2 (D = 0.1175) and 0.99524 for CQ4 (D = 0.009497), would fail
  143 of 145 CQ2 and 5 of 7 CQ4 records. QAT did **not** pull these weights closer to the grid; the rotated groups
  quantise slightly worse than i.i.d. Gaussians.
- PLAN.md's "≥ 0.95 for CQ2" is wrong for the same reason. The measured CQ2 range is 0.93185–0.94008 (median 0.93465),
  and the CQ4 range is 0.99431–0.99537.

**Measured** (`TestWhistleNameMap`): all 681 records pass. The minimum cosine per type is pinned to 1e-9:

| type | records | min cosine     | at                 |
| ---- | ------- | -------------- | ------------------ |
| FP16 | 524     | 0.999999963923 | `enc00.q_norm`     |
| CQ2  | 145     | 0.931853685259 | `cross07.k_proj`   |
| CQ4  | 7       | 0.994312193718 | `enc.mhc_phi_post` |

Every CQ record's width also matches the run's `weight_bits` plan (`embedding=4,stack/mhc=4,encoder/mhc=4,default=2`).
The test runs in about 1.5 s; `RequantCQ` uses an FWHT and is pinned to the matrix reference `portPack`.

**Consequence.** The `.cact` file holds no information beyond the safetensors checkpoint, its config and two constants
(magic and version). Every CQ record is a deterministic function of its source, up to float32 rounding ties. A
safetensors-only load can therefore rebuild the deployment numerics exactly; the derived records need only the
permutation port and the mel recomputation, both in `internal/cact`'s tests.

## F-007 — One lookup over both formats: interface, derived records, cache and mmap (2026-10-09)

**Question.** Model code must read Whistle's tensors the same way from the deployed `.cact` (CQ2/CQ4, FP16) and from
the float32 safetensors checkpoint, which Phase 2 uses as its reference. What does the safetensors side serve for the
five records that have no source (F-006)? What does the cache keep, and for how long? How is the file held, and what
may a caller keep after `Close`?

**Interface.** `internal/weights` `Source`: `Names`, `Has`, `Shape`, `Tensor(name) ([]float32, []int, error)`, `Raw`
(byte blobs), `Config`, `Release` and `Close`. `Cact` and `Safetensors` implement it, and `Open` picks one by the `.cact`
tag. Names are F-006's (`cact.WhistleNames`, or any map passed in `Options.Names`), so model code never sees record
indices or Flax paths. Both backends return the `.cact` layout: `(out, in)` kernels, a layer slice per block, and
lane-major mHC φ. The safetensors side gets there through `Entry.Apply`. At open time, each backend checks every
entry's shape: against its record (`.cact`) or against its source's header shape (safetensors). A wrong map therefore
fails at once, not on first use, and the check reads no tensor data. `safetensors.Store` gained `Shape(name)` for this.

**Config.** `weights.Config` holds the inference geometry that both formats state, mapped as in F-003. For `.cact` it
comes from the header plus the audio manifest; the manifest needs the magic and version 1, as the engine does. For
safetensors it comes from the config, where `Vocab` = `text` + 7, `HadaN` = the next power of two of `dim`, and `Tables`
= `len(orders)` × `hashes`. The checkpoint config has no head count. `Heads` is the row count of `layer00.q_proj` over
`qk_dim` (384 / 48 = 8), checked against the source shape at open time. It equals the header's `num_heads`. Left out:
the token ids (the tokenizer holds them), the KV width (run metadata) and the training keys. Both backends return
identical `Config` values for Whistle.

**Derived records.** The candidates:

| option                                       | `hada_p*`, mel bank, manifest                         | tokenizer                   |
| -------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| recompute in Go                              | exact: F-006 showed each is a function of the config  | impossible: data, no config |
| typed "not available from this format" error | Phase 2 and 3 would need a `.cact` for a float32 load | honest                      |
| read the records from a `.cact` beside it    | a hidden second-file dependency                       | same                        |

Winner: the safetensors backend recomputes the permutations (numpy MT19937), the Slaney mel bank (float64, rounded
once) and the manifest. For the tokenizer, `Raw` returns `ErrUnavailable`, and so does `Tensor` for any derived name it
cannot recompute. The recomputations moved from `internal/cact`'s tests to `internal/cact/derived.go`. They sit beside
`WhistleNames`, which defines those records, and stay in a leaf package that the later `needle` and `frontend` packages
can import without a cycle. On Whistle, all four recomputed records equal the `.cact` ones bit for bit.

**Cache.** The candidates:

- No cache. Every call decodes again; the CQ4 embedding alone takes 15–18 ms to dequantise.
- A bounded LRU. A model keeps every tensor it loads, so evicting one frees nothing while the model holds it.
- Unbounded until `Release(name)` or `Close`. **Winner.**

The cached slice is the very slice the model keeps, so while the model lives the cache costs no extra memory. `Release`
lets code that repacks a tensor (the Phase 9 LUT GEMV) drop the float32 copy. Callers therefore share one slice, which
they must not modify. A per-name `sync.Once` makes concurrent first calls decode once. An `RWMutex` lets `Close` wait for
decodes in flight. A decode error stays cached until `Release`. Measured on an Apple M5 Pro: a cached hit takes under
1 µs. The whole model decodes to 221 MB of float32 in either format, in 0.12–0.14 s from `.cact` and 0.21 s from
safetensors.

**mmap.** Unix (`//go:build unix`) maps the file read-only and shared with `syscall.Mmap`. Cross-vetting showed
`syscall.Mmap` builds for linux, darwin, the BSDs, solaris/illumos, aix and android. Elsewhere (windows, js/wasm,
wasip1, plan9), `mmap_nommap.go` reads the file with `os.ReadFile`. Windows mapping through `CreateFileMapping` is left
for when it is needed. Empty files, and files the system refuses to map, are read too; `Options.NoMmap` forces the read.

| file (M5 Pro)         | open, mapped | heap after open | open, read | heap after open |
| --------------------- | ------------ | --------------- | ---------- | --------------- |
| `whistle.cact`        | 0.4 ms       | +0.1 MB         | 1.6 ms     | +17 MB          |
| `whistle.safetensors` | 0.6 ms       | +0.2 MB         | 12–23 ms   | +221 MB         |

Decoding everything from the read safetensors file holds 442 MB on the heap, against 221 MB when mapped.

**Aliasing rule.** Nothing handed out aliases the file data. The `.cact` readers allocate (FP16/FP32 widening, CQ
dequantisation, and `Raw`, which clones). `Store.Tensor` decodes into a new slice and `Apply` copies. Names, metadata
and the config are copied when the JSON header is decoded. `Close` drops the cache and unmaps; afterwards `Tensor` and
`Raw` return `ErrClosed`, while every slice handed out stays valid. A test checks that no returned slice lies inside the
mapping's address range, and reads every slice again after the unmap. Caveat, as for any mmap reader: truncating the
file under an open source faults the process.

**Cross-format check.** `TestWhistleCrossFormat` covers all 681 names. Shapes are equal for every name and both
`Config` values are equal. The 4 recomputed records are bit-equal. All 524 FP16 records lie within half an FP16 ulp of
their source and meet F-006's rounding bound. For CQ, the minimum cosine per type equals F-006's to 1e-9: FP16
0.999999963923, CQ2 0.931853685259 and CQ4 0.994312193718. Each backend also equals its format's plain reader bit for
bit (`cact.File`; `Store.Tensor` + `Entry.Apply`), so `TestWhistleNameMap`'s per-record CQ thresholds carry over. The
test runs in 0.8 s. Gap: this package checks CQ records against F-006's per-width floor, not against a per-record
requantisation, because the `_cq_pack` port lives in `internal/cact`'s test files.
